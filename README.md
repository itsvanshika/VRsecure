## Problem Statement

Frequently, individuals such as children, the elderly, and women find themselves traveling alone. In these situations, it is common for children to feel frightened, and women to experience a sense of insecurity. Additionally, when elderly individuals travel solo, there is uncertainty about whether they have their necessary emergency medications readily available. Similarly, for people with disabilities, traveling alone presents challenges, as they often lack assurance regarding the availability of suitable amenities at theirÂ destination.
